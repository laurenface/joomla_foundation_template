## NEW ATOMIC

#### A responsive redesign of [Joomla 1.7](http://joomla.org/) [Atomic] template

##### by [Arnold Mwumva Ford](https://twitter.com/fordarnold) , Meridian Softech 

This is a Joomla 1.7+ template built on top of the default "Atomic" Joomla 1.7 template

### The Best Part? 
It's responsive!!! It adjusts according to the device you use. This is because of the [Foundation 2]( http://foundation.zurb.com/) Front-End framework built into it. Now you can view your Joomla! websites on any device.
